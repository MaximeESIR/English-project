You take the fish and start to eat it.
The seawoman starts talking to you "Oh oh,  it seems you like it. If you have money, come back to me ! i am going to the port, and i have a fantastic boat ! "
After that, she starts walking away slowly.


You remember you are in a market and start wandering between the aisles.


Far away, you can distinguish a foutain, and start walking in its direction.
While walking, you understand that this village doesnt feel fair. A loot of people are living in poor living conditions while others are laughing.

<h1>You awaken in a dirty cellar</h1>
The air is heavy and disturbing. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you realize you are lying on a cold stone altar, where you can see ominous bloodstains.
You can hear a eerie silence, broken only by the sound of water drops falling from the ceilling.

A shiver runs through you while you try to make sens of what is happening.
Your senses heightened in this unsettling moment, you have to find an exit, and quickly ! 


Facing a crucial decision, you can see 2 roads in the shadow. The first ascends. The second descends. Maybe one of this path can take you out...

You choose: [[the first path|Gloomy alley]] or [[the second path|inside the Castle]]

At the bottom of the path, you discover a long, dimly lit alley that appears to lead to what seems to be a major street.
About ten meters away, you can see a dog, next to which there is a man, asleep in his chair. This man is dressed in a way that reminds you of the attire worn by guards in old movies..

What do you want to do ? 
[[i'm going to kick the guard !]]

While walking in the alley, you seem to hear voices speaking more and more loudly.
The light is getting brighter. You see shadows moving.
At the end of the alley, you find  an immense noisy place with a lot of people. 
There are some market stall; and smells make you remembering you are hungry.

Someone arrives in the back. It's a woman with a fisherman's outfit.
She walks wobbly, maybe because she likes alcohol.
She holds out a breaded fish towards you: "Ohoh little boy, you seems hungry ! take one of my delicious fish ! "



You have little doubts. Why someone should help you? 


[[I may accept it... | Fish accepted]]
